        <LegalSection heading="2. Scope">
          <p>
            This policy applies to students using the mobile app. Staff use a separate admin
            dashboard governed by internal policies. This policy does not cover third-party websites
            linked from our app or site.

            3.1 Account and profile
          </h3>
          <p>When you register or sign in, we collect:</p>
          <LegalList
            items={[
              "Email address and password (password stored in hashed form by our auth provider)",

            ]}
          />
          <p>
            If you sign in with Google, we receive profile information Google shares with us
            (typically name, email, and profile picture URL). You still complete phone verification
            before full access to the app.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-display text-base font-semibold text-brand-ink">
            3.2 Learning and usage data

          <h3 className="font-display text-base font-semibold text-brand-ink">3.5 Phone number</h3>
          <p>
            We require a verified mobile phone number during signup (after you create your account
            with email or Google). We send a one-time SMS code to confirm you control the number.
            The verified number is stored on your account in our auth system (Supabase).

              "When: Once at signup (and again if you change your number in Profile, when that feature is available).",
              "Login: Ongoing sign-in uses email/password or Google — we do not send an SMS code every time you log in.",
              "Purpose: Reduce fake accounts, abuse, and duplicate registrations; support account recovery where applicable.",
              "SMS providers: Messages are delivered through third-party SMS gateways (regional providers such as for Nepal and India). Providers process your number and message content only to deliver the OTP.",
              "Marketing: We do not send promotional or marketing SMS.",

          <p>
            If you do not complete phone verification, you may not be able to use the app beyond the

            We do not collect payment card data, precise GPS location, contact lists, or use your
            data for cross-app advertising or sale to data brokers.

          <p>
            We do not use student data to train public AI models. AI tools on our platform are used
            by administrators only to assist with content ingestion (e.g. extracting questions from
            past papers) — not by students in the mobile app.
          </p>

          <p>
            These providers process data on our behalf under their own terms and security measures.
            Data may be stored in {PLACEHOLDERS.supabaseRegion} and other regions where these
            providers operate.

        <LegalSection heading="6. Retention">
          <p>
            We retain account and learning data while your account is active. If you request
            deletion, we delete or anonymize personal data within a reasonable period, except where
            law requires longer retention (e.g. security logs).
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection heading="7. Security">
          <p>
            We use industry-standard measures including encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS), access
            controls, and row-level security on our database so users can only access their own data
            where applicable. No method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.

          <p>
            Mediceen is not directed at children under {PLACEHOLDERS.minimumAge}. We do not
            knowingly collect data from anyone below that age. Contact us if you believe we have
            collected a child&apos;s data in error.

        <LegalSection heading="10. International transfers">
          <p>
            If you use Mediceen from outside Nepal, your data may be processed in Nepal and in

            with this policy.
